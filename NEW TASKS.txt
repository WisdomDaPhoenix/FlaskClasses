TASK
Create a temps.txt file with different temperatures in celsius. Your file's content should look like so:

20
40
60
80
100

Save the temps.txt file with these temperatures and answer the following questions below.

SOLUTION

with open('temps.txt','w') as file:
   t = [n * 10 for n in range(2,11,2)]
   for item in t:
          file.write(f"{item} \n")

 
conversions = []       
with open("ftemps","w") as file: 
     temperatures = [int(x.strip()) for x in open("temps.txt")]
     for t in temperatures:
            fval = 9/5 * t + 32 
            conversions.append(fval)
            file.write(f"{ fval } \n")
     
print(conversions)

data = { "Conversion" : conversions }


conversions = json.dumps(data, enable_ascii=False)   # JSON STRING
print(type(conversions))

with open("conversions.json", "w") as file:         # JSON FILE
       json.dump(data, enable_ascii=False)


with open("conversions.json","r") as file:
        mycontent = json.load(file)

print(mycontent)


QUESTIONS:
a) Write python code to read the temps file, convert each temperature to fahrenheit and store the conversions in a new file called ftemps.txt

b) Write python code to store the conversions(fahrenheit values) in a list.

c) Generate a json string of these conversions called "conversions" and test to reaffirm that it is a string.

d) Generate a json file of these conversions called "conversions.json"

e) Write code to display the content of "conversions.json".
